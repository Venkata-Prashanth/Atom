 A robot platform for outdoor autonomous logistic applications. 
 
## About the Project
The focus was to create a low-cost robot platform that could be used for outdoor autonomous logistics applications. The robot was build using the chasis of an old Pioneer 3DX robot from Omron Adept MobileRobots and replace all the electronics on board with new parts according to the required specifications.

PID controller for individual motor velocity control was designed using simulink and matlab using system identification.

#### Configuration
ROS version: ROS noetic in Ubuntu 20.04.
Microcontroller: Arduino Mega.
Actuators: Cytron BDC motors and motor drivers.
Power supply: Leadacid batteries.
