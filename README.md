 A robot platform for outdoor autonomous logistic applications. 
 
## About the Project
___
The focus was to create a low-cost robot platform that could be used for outdoor autonomous logistics applications. As of now, I am trying to use the metal structure of an old Pioneer 3DX robot from Omron Adept MobileRobots and replace all the electronics on board with new parts according to the required specifications.

## Development - Milestones
___
 #### Completed
- Control the robot using Arduino with ROS-noetic environment.
#### In progress.
- Implement PID control algorithms for motor speed and torque control.
- Change the Arduino to an industrial MCU (STM32).
- Integrate additional sensors (IMU and sonar array).
